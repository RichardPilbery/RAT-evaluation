## Abstract

### Introduction
Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health problem leading to a substantial number of deaths in the UK. Survival to discharge rates in the UK have remained below that of the best performing European countries. In response to this, Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) has introduced several initiatives to improve outcome from OHCA including the introduction of Red Arrest Teams (RATs).

This study aims to determine the impact of the RATs on survival to 30 days and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital.

### Methods
A retrospective cohort study analysing routinely collected data was undertaken. All adult (â‰¥18 years) OHCAs entered onto the YAS computer aided dispatch (CAD) system between the 1st October, 2015 and 30th September, 2017 were included if the patient was resuscitated, and the cause of the arrest was considered to be medical in origin. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to enable adjustment for common predictors of survival and ROSC.

### Results

### Conclusion
The presence of a RAT paramedic was associated with a small increase in survival to 30 days and ROSC on arrival at hospital, although neither were statistically significant. Larger prospective studies are required to determine the effect of roles such as RAT on outcomes from OHCA
