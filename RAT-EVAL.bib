	abstract = {Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is the most common, immediately life-threatening, medical emergency faced by ambulance crews. Survival from OHCA is largely dependent on quality of prehospital resuscitation. Non-technical skills, including resuscitation team leadership, communication and clinical decision-making are important in providing high quality prehospital resuscitation. We describe a pilot study (TOPCAT2, TC2) to establish a second tier, expert paramedic response to OHCA in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Methods Eight paramedics were selected to undergo advanced training in resuscitation and non-technical skills. Simulation and video feedback was used during training. The designated TC2 paramedic manned a regular ambulance service response car and attended emergency calls in the usual manner. Emergency medical dispatch centre dispatchers were instructed to call the TC2 paramedic directly on receipt of a possible OHCA call. Call and dispatch timings, quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and return-of-spontaneous circulation were all measured prospectively.
Results Establishing a specialist, second-tier paramedic response was feasible. There was no overall impact on ambulance response times. From the first 40 activations, the TC2 paramedic was activated in a median of 3.2 min (IQR 1.6–5.8) and on-scene in a median of 10.8 min (8.0–17.9). Bimonthly team debrief, case review and training sessions were successfully established. OHCA attended by TC2 showed an additional trend towards improved outcome with a rate of return of spontaneous circulation of 22.5\%, compared with a national average of 16\%.
Conclusions Establishing a specialist, second-tier response to OHCA is feasible, without impacting on overall ambulance response times. Improving non-technical skills, including prehospital resuscitation team leadership, has the potential to save lives and further research on the impact of the TOPCAT2 pilot programme is warranted.},

	abstract = {Aim
To assess the impact of a pre-hospital critical care team (CCT) on survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
Methods
We undertook a retrospective observational study, comparing OHCA patients attended by advanced life support (ALS) paramedics with OHCA patients attended by ALS paramedics and a CCT between April 2011 and April 2013 in a single ambulance service in Southwest England. We used multiple logistic regression to control for an anticipated imbalance of prognostic factors between the groups. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. All data were collected independently of the research.
Results
1851 cases of OHCA were included in the analysis, of which 1686 received ALS paramedic treatment and 165 were attended by both ALS paramedics and a CCT. Unadjusted rates of survival to hospital discharge were significantly higher in the CCT group, compared to the ALS paramedic group (15.8\% and 6.5\%, respectively, p{\textless}0.001). After adjustment using multiple logistic regression, the effect of CCT treatment was no longer statistically significant (OR 1.54, 95\% CI 0.89–2.67, p=0.13). Subgroup analysis of OHCA with first monitored rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia showed similar results.
Conclusion
Pre-hospital critical care for OHCA was not associated with significantly improved rates of survival to hospital discharge. These results are in keeping with previously published studies. Further research with a larger sample size is required to determine whether CCTs can improve outcome in OHCA.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.resuscitation.2017.02.018},
	abstract = {Background
Improving survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a priority for modern emergency medical services (EMS) and prehospital research. Advanced life support (ALS) is now the standard of care in most EMS. In some EMS, prehospital critical care providers are also dispatched to attend OHCA. This systematic review presents the evidence for prehospital critical care for OHCA, when compared to standard ALS care.
Methods
We searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, EmBASE, CINAHL Plus and AMED (via EBSCO), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, NIHR Health Technology Assessment Database, Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov. Search terms related to cardiac arrest and prehospital critical care. All studies that compared patient-centred outcomes between prehospital critical care and ALS for OHCA were included.
Results
The review identified six full text publications that matched the inclusion criteria, all of which are observational studies. Three studies showed no benefit from prehospital critical care but were underpowered with sample sizes of 1028–1851. The other three publications showed benefit from prehospital critical care delivered by physicians. However, an imbalance of prognostic factors and hospital treatment in these studies systematically favoured the prehospital critical care group.
Conclusion
Current evidence to support prehospital critical care for OHCA is limited by the logistic difficulties of undertaking high quality research in this area. Further research needs an appropriate sample size with adjustments for confounding factors in observational research design.},

	abstract = {Objectives The Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Outcomes (OHCAO) project aims to understand the epidemiology and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) across the UK. This data linkage study is a subproject of OHCAO. The aim was to establish the feasibility of linking OHCAO data to National Health Service (NHS) patient demographic data and Office for National Statistics (ONS) date of death data held on the NHS Personal Demographics Service (PDS) database to improve OHCAO demographic data quality and enable analysis of 30-day survival from OHCA.
Design and setting Data were collected from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014 as part of a prospective, observational study of OHCA attended by 10 English NHS Ambulance Services. 28 729 OHCA cases had resuscitation attempted by Emergency Medical Services and were included in the study. Data linkage was carried out using a data linkage service provided by NHS Digital, a national provider of health-related data. To assess data linkage feasibility a random sample of 3120 cases was selected. The sample was securely transferred to NHS Digital to be matched using OHCAO patient demographic data to return previously missing demographic data and provide ONS date of death data.
Results A total of 2513 (80.5\%) OHCAO cases were matched to patients in the NHS PDS database. Using the linkage process, missing demographic data were retrieved for 1636 (72.7\%) out of 2249 OHCAO cases that had previously incomplete demographic data. Returned ONS date of death data allowed analysis of 30-day survival status. The results showed a 30-day survival rate of 9.3\%, reducing unknown survival status from 46.1\% to 8.5\%.
Conclusions In this sample, data linkage between the OHCAO registry and NHS PDS database was shown to be feasible, improving demographic data quality and allowing analysis of 30-day survival status.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Team-focused CPR (TFCPR) is a choreographed approach to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with emphasis on minimally interrupted high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, discourages endotracheal intubation and encourages use of the bag-valve-mask (BVM) and/or blind-insertion airway device (BIAD) with a ventilation rate of 8-10 breaths/min to minimize hyperventilation. Widespread incorporation of TFCPR in North Carolina (NC) EMS agencies began in 2011, yet its impact on outcomes is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether TFCPR improves survival with good neurological outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients compared to standard CPR.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis of NC EMS agencies reporting data to the Cardiac Arrest Registry for Enhanced Survival (CARES) database from January 2010 to June 2014 included adult, non-traumatic OHCA with presumed cardiac etiology where EMS performed CPR or patient received defibrillation. Exclusions were arrest terminated per EMS policy or DNR. EMS agencies self-reported the TFCPR implementation dates. Patients were categorized as receiving either TFCPR or standard CPR. The primary outcome was good neurologic outcome at time of hospital discharge defined as Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1-2.
RESULTS: Of 14,994 OHCAs, 14,129 patients were included for analysis with a mean age 65 (IQR 50-81) years, 61\% male, 7.3\% with good neurologic outcome, 24.3\% with shockable initial rhythm, and 71.5\% receiving TFCPR. Of the 3427 (24.3\%) with an initial shockable rhythm, 739 (71.9\%) had a good neurological outcome. Good neurologic outcome was higher with TFCPR [836 (8.3\%, 95\%CI 7.7-8.8\%)] vs. standard CPR [193 (4.8\%, 95\%CI 4.2-5.5\%)]. Logistic regression controlling for demographic and arrest characteristics revealed TFCPR (OR 1.5), witnessed arrest (OR 4.3), initial shockable rhythm (OR 7.1), and in-hospital hypothermia (OR 3.3) were associated with good neurologic outcome. Mechanical CPR device (OR 0.68), CPR feedback device (OR 0.47), and endotracheal intubation (OR 0.44) were associated with less likelihood for a good neurologic outcome.
CONCLUSION: In our statewide OHCA cohort, TFCPR was associated with improved survival with good neurological outcome.},

	abstract = {Background
The presence of physicians is believed to facilitate optimal management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but has not been sufficiently documented.
Methods
Adult non-traumatic cardiac arrests treated by Oslo EMS between May 2003 and April 2008 were prospectively registered. Patients were categorized according to being treated by the physician-manned ambulance (PMA) or by regular paramedic-manned ambulances (non-PMA). Patient records and continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) with impedance signals were reviewed. Quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical outcomes were compared.
Results
Resuscitation was attempted in 1128 cardiac arrests, of which 151 treated by non-PMA and PMA together were excluded from comparative analysis. Of the remaining 977 patients, 232 (24\%) and 741 (76\%) were treated by PMA and non-PMA, respectively. The PMA group was more likely to have bystander witnessed arrests and initial VF/VT, and received better CPR quality with shorter hands-off intervals and pre-shock pauses, and having a greater proportion of patients being intubated. Despite uneven distribution of positive prognostic factors and better CPR quality, short-term and long-term survival were not different for patients treated by the PMA vs. non-PMA, with 34\% vs. 33\% (p=0.74) achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), 28\% vs. 25\% (p=0.50) being admitted to ICU and 13\% vs. 11\% (p=0.28) being discharged from hospital, respectively.
Conclusions
Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was not different for patients treated by the PMA and non-PMA in our EMS system.},

	abstract = {Introduction
There is an increasing interest in human factors within the healthcare environment reflecting the understanding of their impact on safety. The aim of this paper is to explore how human factors might be taught on resuscitation courses, and improve course outcomes in terms of improved mortality and morbidity for patients. The delivery of human factors training is important and this review explores the work that has been delivered already and areas for future research and teaching.
Method
Medline was searched using MESH terms Resuscitation as a Major concept and Patient or Leadership as core terms. The abstracts were read and 25 full length articles reviewed.
Results
Critical incident reporting has shown four recurring problems: lack of organisation at an arrest, lack of equipment, non functioning equipment, and obstructions preventing good care. Of these, the first relates directly to the concept of human factors. Team dynamics for both team membership and leadership, management of stress, conflict and the role of debriefing are highlighted. Possible strategies for teaching them are discussed.
Conclusions
Four strategies for improving human factors training are discussed: team dynamics (including team membership and leadership behaviour), the influence of stress, debriefing, and conflict within teams. This review illustrates how human factor training might be integrated further into life support training without jeopardising the core content and lengthening the courses.},

	abstract = {Despite substantial efforts to make cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) algorithms known to healthcare workers, the outcome of CPR has remained poor during the past decades. Resuscitation teams often deviate from algorithms of CPR. Emerging evidence suggests that in addition to technical skills of individual rescuers, human factors such as teamwork and leadership affect adherence to algorithms and hence the outcome of CPR. This review describes the state of the science linking team interactions to the performance of CPR. Because logistical barriers make controlled measurement of team interaction in the earliest moments of real-life resuscitations challenging, our review focuses mainly on high-fidelity human simulator studies. This technique allows in-depth investigation of complex human interactions using precise and reproducible methods. It also removes variability in the clinical parameters of resuscitation, thus letting researchers study human factors and team interactions without confounding by clinical variability from resuscitation to resuscitation. Research has shown that a prolonged process of team building and poor leadership behavior are associated with significant shortcomings in CPR. Teamwork and leadership training have been shown to improve subsequent team performance during resuscitation and have recently been included in guidelines for advanced life support courses. We propose that further studies on the effects of team interactions on performance of complex medical emergency interventions such as resuscitation are needed. Future efforts to better understand the influence of team factors (e.g., team member status, team hierarchy, handling of human errors), individual factors (e.g., sex differences, perceived stress), and external factors (e.g., equipment, algorithms, institutional characteristics) on team performance in resuscitation situations are critical to improve CPR performance and medical outcomes of patients.},

	abstract = {Background—Although out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public health problem, individual paramedics are rarely exposed to these cases. In this study, we examined whether previous paramedic exposure to OHCA resuscitation is associated with patient survival.
Methods and Results—For the period 2003 to 2012, we linked data from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry to Ambulance Victoria’s employment data set. We defined exposure as the number of times a paramedic attended an OHCA where resuscitation was attempted in the 3 years preceding each case. Using a multivariable model adjusting for known predictors of survival, we measured the association between paramedic OHCA exposure and patient survival to hospital discharge. During the study period, there were 4151 paramedics employed and 48 291 OHCAs (44\% with resuscitation attempted). The median exposure of all paramedics was 2 (interquartile range 1–3) OHCAs/year. Eleven percent of paramedics were not exposed to any OHCA cases. Increased paramedic exposure was associated with reduced odds of attempted resuscitation (P{\textless}0.001). In the 3 years preceding each OHCA where resuscitation was attempted, the median exposure of the treating paramedics was 11 (interquartile range 6–17) OHCAs. Compared with patients treated by paramedics with a median of ≤6 exposures during the previous 3 years (7\% survival), the odds of survival were higher for patients treated by paramedics with {\textgreater}6 to 11 (12\%, adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95\% confidence interval 1.04–1.54), {\textgreater}11 to 17 (14\%, adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95\% confidence interval 1.04–1.59), and {\textgreater}17 exposures (17\%, adjusted odds ratio 1.50, 95\% confidence interval 1.22–1.86). Paramedic years of experience were not associated with survival.
Conclusions—Patient survival after OHCA significantly increases with the number of OHCAs that paramedics have previously treated.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2016;9:154-160. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.115.002317.)},

	abstract = {Methods: Observational study including persons registered with ﬁrst-time OHCA of any cause in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry during 2005–2012. We used logistic regression analysis to assess the association between 30-day survival and involvement of a physician at any time before arrival at the hospital. Secondary outcomes were 1-year survival and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) before arrival at the hospital. The associations were explored in three multivariable models: a model with simple adjustment, a model with multiple imputation of missing variables, and a propensity score model where exposed subjects were matched 1:1 with unexposed subjects on a propensity score reﬂecting the probability of being assigned to the exposure group.
Results: 21,165 persons with OHCA during 2005–2012 were included. Overall, 10.8\% of OHCA patients with physician involvement and 8.1\% of OHCA patients without physician involvement before arrival at hospital were alive after 30 days, crude odds ratio (OR) = 1.37 (95\% CI = 1.24–1.51), adjusted OR = 1.18 (95\% CI = 1.04–1.34). Physician involvement was also positively associated with ROSC, OR = 1.09 (95\% CI = 1.00–1.19); and with 1-year survival, OR = 1.13 (95\% CI = 0.99–1.29).
Conclusion: In this large population-based observational study, we found prehospital physician involvement after OHCA associated with better 30-day survival. This association was also found for ROSC, but with less certainty for 1-year survival.},

	abstract = {Objective Post-resuscitation care may influence outcome following transport to hospital after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). This study aimed to determine whether receiving hospital characteristics such as 24-h cardiac catheterisation services, total bed number or OHCA patient volume influence the rate of survival.
Setting Data were analysed from the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry of patients from January 2003 to March 2010 who were transported to hospital with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA.
Results Ambulance paramedics attended 9971 patients with OHCA of suspected cardiac cause during the study period. Of these, 2902 (29\%) achieved ROSC and were transported to one of 70 hospitals. 1816 (63\%) were treated at hospitals with 24-h cardiac interventional services. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics, hospital factors significantly associated with survival were treatment at hospitals with 24-h cardiac interventional services (OR 1.40; 95\% CI 1.12 to 1.74, p=0.003) and patient reception between 08:00 and 17:00 hours (OR 1.34; 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.64, p=0.004). OHCA patient volume and total hospital bed number were not independently associated with outcome.
Conclusion Hospital characteristics are associated with improved survival in patients with OHCA. This finding has implications for the establishment of regionalised systems of care for patients who have been resuscitated from OHCA.},
